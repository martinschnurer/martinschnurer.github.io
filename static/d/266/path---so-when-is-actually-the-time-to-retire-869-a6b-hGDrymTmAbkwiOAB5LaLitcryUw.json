Maybe the answer automatically popped up in your head - I retire, when my government retirement age tells me to retire.</p>\n<p>Though, the second deeper questions may sounds like <em>“Can I retire earlier than the government allow me to?”</em></p>\n<p>The answer is <em>Maybe</em>.</p>\n<p>There are some variables in the game, which could help us with predicting the age of retiring earlier:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your average monthly expenses</strong> - this one is simple. The amount of money going out of your pocket, bank account or whatever else you have money in</li>\n<li><strong>Your salary</strong> - The amount of money coming to your pocket or bank account</li>\n<li><strong>The percentage amount of your salary going to saving/investment account</strong> - How much money going out to your investment portfolio? Let’s say your income is 2000€ and 200€ goes to investment account, then you have 10% of your income goes to investment account.</li>\n<li><strong>The portfolio yearly grow</strong> - You expect your portfolio to grow. Otherwise you wouldn’t send money there. Let’s say your portfolio consists of stocks. One share of stock has some value let’s say 100€. If the next year the value of this stock is 110€, then the growth of this stock share is 10%. If you had all your money invested in this one stock and you had bought shares of this stock - then your portfolio growth would have also 10% growth. I would highly don’t recommend doing this - you should never have all your money invested in one stock unless you really know what you do. You want to have your porfolio to be diversified and have money in different places at one time. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>The weighten average of all growths from all places where your money is placed in is then growth of your portfolio.</em></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Yearly dividend yield of portfolio</strong> - For example, if your money is placed in stocks you can expect a dividend yield the time range - for example <em>S&#x26;P500 index fund</em> recently had 2% dividend yield - it means the 2% of the money invested in this fund is paid to you every year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Your age</strong> is very important here, but for the sake of simplicty I will assume you are relatively young enough.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why are these things important? In the 5. item of the list above I mentioned <em>yearly dividend</em>. You can be paid on the yearly basis! </p>\n<p>Now the question you can ask is - how much do I need on my investment portfolios, so the yearly dividends cover all my expenses ? In other words - you don’t have to go to the work again because your side income of portfolio covers all your expenses = <strong>retirement</strong>! When is that time? </p>\n<p>When? This is the most difficult question ever given. We can approximate the result, but not predict for sure.</p>\n<p>There are millions of possible scenarios that can happen. You can die, lose job, lose health. Then there can be next war, financial crysis, recessions, bank crashes, hyper-inflation. Thousands of things to cut you off the idea of earlier retirerement - but this is pessimistic point of view. Instead, we can take a look at the most common and probable scenario.</p>\n<h1>Inflation</h1>\n<p>One thing I want to explain is the inflation. <strong>Inflation</strong> is, when prices goes up. On the other hand, if prices goes down - it is <strong>deflation</strong>. The economy is healthy, when there is a little bit of inflation. The average inflation rate is 2-3%. This means that year later, for what you paid 100€ - now you have to pay 103€. </p>\n<p>This is the reason why our parents are always telling us they could afford the whole shopping cart for a few pennies before years. That is true, but the salaries were lower too!</p>\n<p>I don’t want to go to the details. One thing for sure - <strong>inflation makes prices every year higher</strong>.</p>\n<p>Why am I telling this to you? Because when your monthly expenses is now 100€ then in 30 years from now it will be 181€ - and this doesn’t mean you will spend more. Instead, you will pay 181€ for the same things you bought 30 years ago.</p>\n<p>The reason I am telling you this is that the inflation has a big impact on portfolio, your salary, your expenses and therefore on the age you are going to retire!</p>\n<h1>So when am I going to retire?</h1>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the dividend yield of your portfolio must cover all your expenses.</p>\n<p>When your yealy expenses are 10000€ and your dividend yield will be 10000€, hurray, you can possibly retire.</p>\n<p>Everything is better understood when there is example.</p>\n<p>You make <strong>2000€ monthly</strong>, giving <strong>25%</strong> (500€) to the saving/investment account/portfolio with the <strong>average yearly growth of 6%</strong> and with <strong>yearly dividend yield 2%</strong>. Your <strong>monthly expenses are 600€</strong> and the <strong>inflation is 2%</strong> on average.</p>\n<p>The answer is: <strong>36 years</strong> and <a href=\"#compute\">below</a> is described a mathematical solution. You can say that this is too long. And it is. We didn’t take some things into consideration: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Job promotion - if you started somewhere now, you can expect promotion and higher salary.</li>\n<li>Adjust money you are giving to your saving account year by year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: Your employer should always rise your salary at least as much as how the big the inflation rate currently is. The promotion means you’re going to get higher salary by more than 2% - which is the average inflation rate</em></p>\n<p>With adjusted inflation and promotion, the result is now: <strong>27 years</strong>. Which is 9 years difference compared to the not-adjusting investment behaviour.</p>\n<p>Now we can’t do much about it, we can balance our variables to retire yearlier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cut expenses: If you cut your expenses down, you can retire earlier</li>\n<li>Invest better: If you can reach higher than 6% portfolio growth, go for it. You will retire earlier.</li>\n<li>Invest more: You have money laying in your bank and don’t know what to do with them? Invest them! - note that by holding your money in a bank account, they are depreciating on the value (2% yearly) - as I mentioned the inflation thing above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name=\"compute\"></a></p>\n<h1>How to compute the yearly retirement age</h1>\n<p>I computed the examples with the help of WolframAlpha and you can see previous example computed <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(sum(500*12*1.06%5Ei*1.02%5Ei*1.005%5Ei)+from+i+%3D+1+to+x+)*0.02+%3E+600*12*1.02%5Ex\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/1-8aa8fd20bd18c46b8ba5c0c193a0cdad.gif\" alt=\"Retirement formula\"></p>\n<p>This is a little bit math. But let’s take a look: 500 is the value you are starting with. We are investing every year, every month - therefore Every year, means we sum our investmens over and over and summing. The <em>12</em> means number of months in a year. <em>1.06</em> is continual portfolio grow year by year. <em>1.02</em> means, we investing more money every year and keep up our investments with the inflation. <em>1.005</em> is the example of job promotion - it can be higher it can be lower - this is a little bit magic constant. <em>0.02</em> is the dividend yield of the whole portfolio every year.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the inequality, we have our expenses <em>600</em> and will grow on average by <em>1.02</em> (2%). <em>12</em> is again number of months in a year.</p>\n<p>We are finding <strong>x</strong> values for which the inequality will be satisfied. And the first value satisfying the inequality is the solution to your question: “After how many years can I retire” :).</p>\n<p>I hope I interested you a little bit with these concepts and also hope, you’ll some more information about investing. </p>\n<p>Have a nice day!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"So when is actually the time to retire?","date":"May 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/so-when-is-actually-the-time-to-retire/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-list-of-dont-knows/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My don't know list for 2019","publish":true}},"next":null}}
