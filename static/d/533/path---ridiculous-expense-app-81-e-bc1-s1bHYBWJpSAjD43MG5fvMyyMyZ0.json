Problem was, I don’t know how to create\nandroid/iOS applications and in past I had only experience with creating\nweb applications.\nLoading web page and interacting with the web app inside a mobile\nbrowser is not as good user experience as directly interacting with native mobile\napp on your android/iOS (or other phone).\nAs I said, I was only experienced in web development. By the time, I didn’t know\nanything about PWA (Progressive Web App) and as I have later realized, interacting with\nweb app in mobile phone doesn’t need to be such a pain as I thought.</p>\n<p>I also have some experience with backend things such as Node.js, Express, Django,\nPostgreSQL, AWS solutions. On frontend it was mainly React.\nI immediately started to work on\nReact App, installing all required packages, routes, redux,\napollo. Then on the backend side express, graphql, postgres - also\nsetupped docker for the easy database access.</p>\n<p>A lot of ideas popped in my head. Really great UX, minimalistic design, great\ncustomization of charts, notifications, progress tracking, saving money\nstrategy, tags for expenses etc.</p>\n<p>Great start!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541591708423-9001fe827349?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&#x26;auto=format&#x26;fit=crop&#x26;w=800&#x26;q=60\" alt=\"mobile phone\"></p>\n<h1>When you’ve got an idea, it’s already alive implemented someone else</h1>\n<p>You know, my first intention was to easily and efficiently\nwrite down my expenses. As the ideas popped out, my mind focused on\naccomplishing these little things for the app - fast app, great design, user\nexperience, customization. </p>\n<p>I knew there must be some finance app already implemented. I searched for these apps\nand I soon realized, there are thousands of these apps. I checked for a few of them\nand was crushed of their look and functionality. They also came with the\nsolutions on a problems I didn’t even realize can occur (for example currency and\nperiodical income). I was quite demotivated, as there were another apps (and\neven web apps) I didn’t even want to visit as I thought\nit had no really logical reason to do. </p>\n<p>The final nail in the coffin was when my bank came with the update in their app\nand implemented a lot of features I was planning to add to my “app”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/IHnROpQICe4kE/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c79ab2a366e45765165f017\" alt=\"simplify man\"></p>\n<h1>Make “App” with Google Forms and Google Sheet</h1>\n<p>You go to the Safari / Chrome (on android), tap add on screen,\nthen new icon is added on your screen, and basically you are done.\nWhat happened is that you added some kind of link to the webpage,\nwhich is link to your google form. The “App” added to your home\nscreen is basically browser cleaned from other functions and\nnow it got only view function. Of course if you want to use\nthe forms you will need the internet connection (You will\nreceive dinosaur page or unable to connect page). </p>\n<p>Okay, now you are done and next time you spend some money\nfill that form in 30 seconds, confirm and that’s it.\nYour data is saved.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Easy and effective way of managing expenses","date":"March 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ridiculous-expense-app/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-blog-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My new blog post!"}},"next":null}}
