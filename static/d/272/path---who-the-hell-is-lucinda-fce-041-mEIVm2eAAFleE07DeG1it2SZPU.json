Her name was generated with random name generator and I’m not joking now.</p>\n<p>Lucinda looks somewhat like this:</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<p><img src=\"/catt-465668594d908ae48ad1d27b5190e543.svg\" alt=\"cat\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>Yes - she is cat. Okay, let’s be a little more serious now. Lucinda is a name of my new personal project. Its name was really generated by random name generator and the project’s mascot is a cat because I just love cats - I think they are cute, fluffy, lazy - also bitches. When they are not in their mood you can’t do much with them. They come to you only when their stomach is empty.</p>\n<h2>Why I started and why am I writing about it</h2>\n<p>I’ve got a ton of personal projects. They are abandoned, buggy, sleeping somewhere in remote git repository. They didn’t get my full attention and as the time flew my attention converged to zero. All the abandoned projects were at least good for one thing - I learned new things with them, I tried new technologies, libraries, new architectural approaches, new languages. </p>\n<p>I have realized that I know a lot of technical skills but I have no real examples for eventual employer to prove that I really know what I say I know.</p>\n<p>So I picked project management software. I’ve seen some of them and I thought I could do better. Why not. Worst case scenario is that I lose time and don’t learn anything. I expect to learn at least something.</p>\n<h2>Stack, or what I’m gonna use</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Frontend</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>React</li>\n<li>CSS/Sass</li>\n<li>Redux</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Backend</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typescript / Node.js</li>\n<li>Dynamo-DB</li>\n<li>AWS Lambda</li>\n<li>OAuth</li>\n<li>GraphQL</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Modeling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use case diagrams</li>\n<li>Sequential diagrams</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Use Case Diagram</h2>\n<p>Use case diagram is a diagram showing what users can possible do in your app. You can map different users and map all things (Use cases) they can possibly do. Use Case diagram should also contain include and exclude connections between UCs but for sake of simplicity I decided to not include these types of things and keep everything as simple as it possibly could be.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uc_v3-6401763a0b13a5feebfe90e967ae71af.svg\" alt=\"use case diagram\"></p>\n<p>It’s a good practice to name your use cases like UC0001: {Short name}, UC0002: {Short name}. Number at the beginning is then used as fast identificator for other related diagrams and so on. </p>\n<p>I named CRUD for Create Read Update Delete - It keeps diagram smaller and in the future I can make UC like UC0012.1, UC0012.2 or finally use another include and exclude use case and connect it with parent CRUD use case. For now, I don’t want to be UC too packed. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Who the hell is Lucinda?","date":"August 28, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/who-the-hell-is-lucinda/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-difference-between-includes-and-extends-in-use-case-diagram/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the difference between includes and extends notation in use case diagram?","publish":null}},"next":null}}
