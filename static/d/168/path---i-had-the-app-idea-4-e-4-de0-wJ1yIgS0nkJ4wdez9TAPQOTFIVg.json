You control a small snake at the beginning of the game and while you eating small food objects you get bigger and bigger and bigger. When some snake hit your body with its head - it dies and a lot of food drops out of him and then you can eat that food and get bigger. Same rules applies for you as well, when you hit some snake you are going to die.\nIn the platform in the top right corner there was a leaderboard which shows who has the most points (who is the biggest snake in the game). Some players got weird names though - kick4ass, iLoveYourMom, iHateSchool…</p>\n<p>This was the first basic idea - promotion by leaderboard. If you are lucky snake, you can kill the biggest snake and eat all his points and get to the first position in a leaderboard (or in top 10). If you are really good it should be easy to get to the top really fast.</p>\n<p>What if we could do the same thing to the real world problem. I was thinking about how many good untouched artists there are in the world, how many small companies, small restaurants, small coffees, good places and people. There are also a lot of people which are popular and don’t deserve as much popularity as they get. So I came with the which would potentially solve the problem.</p>\n<p>The platform would be kind of social network where all posts are sorted by <strong>hits</strong> which has gained through all its lifetime. There would be three panels where user could be navigated to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top</li>\n<li>Hot</li>\n<li>Following</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <strong>Top</strong> the most hit posts globally would be presented. In <strong>Hot</strong> the most <em>hitted</em> posts would be shown (the posts with highest temperature has the most hits per seconds gained). In <strong>Following</strong> there would be posts of the people you follow.</p>\n<p>The feature which is different to all the social platform is that you can hit the post more than once. Another different feature is that as the author of the Post or Comment you can transform hits gained from that Post/Comment to another Post or Comment. It is called <em>Donation</em>. Donations are also presented to the user of the platform in the <strong>Top</strong> view where these donations are also sorted by its size - how much hits was donated. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I had the app idea","date":"July 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/i-had-the-app-idea/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/so-i-got-master-degree-is-it-worth-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"So I've got Master's degree - Is the college really worth it?","publish":null}},"next":null}}
