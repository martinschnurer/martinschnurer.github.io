Problem was, I don’t know how to create\nandroid/iOS applications and in past I had only experience with creating\nweb applications.\nLoading web page and interacting with the web app inside a mobile\nbrowser is not as good user experience as directly interacting with native mobile\napp on your android/iOS (or other phone).\nAs I said, I was only experienced in web development. By the time, I didn’t know\nanything about PWA (Progressive Web App) and as I have later realized, interacting with\nweb app in mobile phone doesn’t need to be such a pain as I thought.</p>\n<p>I also have some experience with backend things such as Node.js, Express, Django,\nPostgreSQL, AWS solutions. On frontend it was mainly React.\nI immediately started to work on\nReact App, installing all required packages, routes, redux,\napollo. Then on the backend side express, graphql, postgres - also\nsetupped docker for the easy database access.</p>\n<p>A lot of ideas popped in my head. Really great UX, minimalistic design, great\ncustomization of charts, notifications, progress tracking, saving money\nstrategy, tags for expenses etc.</p>\n<p>Great start!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541591708423-9001fe827349?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&#x26;auto=format&#x26;fit=crop&#x26;w=800&#x26;q=60\">mobile phone</a></p>\n<h1>When you got the idea, there is a high change someone implemented it already</h1>\n<p>You know, my first intention was to easily and efficiently\nwrite down my expenses. As the ideas popped out, my mind focused on\naccomplishing these little things for the app - fast app, great design, user\nexperience, customization. </p>\n<p>I knew there must be some finance app already implemented. I searched for these apps\nand I soon realized, there are thousands of these apps. I checked for a few of them\nand was crushed of their look and functionality. They also came with the\nsolutions on a problems I didn’t even realize can occur (for example currency and\nperiodical income). I was quite demotivated, as there were another apps (and\neven web apps) I didn’t even want to visit as I thought\nit had no really logical reason to do.</p>\n<p>The final nail in the coffin was when my bank came with the update in their app\nand implemented a lot of features I was planning to add to my “app”.</p>\n<h1>Back to the beginning</h1>\n<p>My purpose was to track <strong>my</strong> expenses. In the end, I was the person, that want\nto customize the charts and all the things I would probably don’t need\nat all. I was designing something for someone who doesn’t even\nexist and who won’t use what I would create.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/IHnROpQICe4kE/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c79ab2a366e45765165f017\">simplify man</a> </p>\n<p>I don’t know where it came from, but I get the idea I will tracking my expenses\nwith Google Forms and Google Sheet. I have set up a new form, added form questions\nnecessary for tracking expense such as value, category, tags. You can even request\nto upload photo (for example book of receipts). some</p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms\">https://docs.google.com/forms</a>.\nIf you are paranoid about google tracking you and your data, I have bad\nnews for you - this article and way is not suitable for you :(\nIf you haven’t account on google/gmail - sign in, and then go to the link\nabove.</p>\n<p>First step is simple. Create a new form. Don’t forget to give your new form\nsome really nice name.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/3a642/s1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 53.82812499999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"google forms\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/40fad/s1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/707e9/s1.png 148w,\n/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/649e0/s1.png 295w,\n/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/40fad/s1.png 590w,\n/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/b3fef/s1.png 885w,\n/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/301c0/s1.png 1180w,\n/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/b5a53/s1.png 1770w,\n/static/e5be2cc7f8d18282385467aac6e02d69/3a642/s1.png 2560w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Now you should see your blank form.

We set up question as ”<em>short answer</em>”.\nNext below the input you’ve got some options. One of them is to set your\nquestion as <strong>required</strong>. You always want to force yourself to fill up this\nvalue, so it is pretty nice to validate if you actually fill this input. On the\nright from the “required” option you have three dots option. Click on that icon\nand select <em>Response validation</em>. Now next options popped up. You want to\nchoose validation by <em>Regular expression</em>, where value <strong>matches</strong> the\nexpression <code class=\"language-text\">^[\\d]+(,[\\d]+)?$</code> and when value doesn’t match specified\nregular expression, then it will simply show message <strong>Only number such as 5 or 5,15 is valid number</strong>.\nWhy it can’t be 5.15 ? I will describe the problem later.</p>\n<p>Basically, the regular expression is telling the google forms, what is a valid\nvalues for this questions. So it accepts digits and numbers, like 5 or 5,15. Easy.</p>\n<p>In validation options, there is also option <em>number</em> validation. But it would\naccepts also number like 5.15, which we don’t want :)</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s3.png\">creating your google form</a></p>\n<p>Step 2. - Describe your item. For example “Bus tickets to NY”, “Groceries shopping”,\n“New clothes for party” etc.</p>\n<p>This time, you just set question and short answer, nothing more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s4.png\">description of your item</a></p>\n<p>Step 3. - Add category to your item. Here you can add whatever you want. My\nrecommendation is to sort items in list by the frequency of item usage. You want\nmost frequent have always on the top. So if you are going to restaurant every day,\nlet <em>restaurant</em> be at the very top of your list to make yourself life easier.</p>\n<p>My list is as follow: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Groceries</li>\n<li>Transportation</li>\n<li>Restaurant/food/drinks </li>\n<li>Phone</li>\n<li>Cinema, theater, free time</li>\n<li>My own hobbies</li>\n<li>Rent</li>\n<li>Clothing</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"./s5.png\">Category</a></p>\n<p>Step 4. (Optional) - Google forms automatically remember exactly when you filled\nup the form but in case you track an expense in another date, you can manually\nfill the date (when you paid for something).</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s6.png\">Category</a></p>\n<p>Step 5. (Optional) - Do you want to save the photo of your receipt for some reason?\nIt is possible to upload file! In this case, you want to upload photo.</p>\n<p>At this question you can specify the file type - <em>Choose Image</em>, let another\nsettings to be as they are (as well as on the screenshot below).</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s7.png\">Category</a></p>\n<p>At this time you are done with the form. You can specify how much you spent,\ndescribe item, categorize and optionally set date when it happened and upload\nphoto of your receipt.</p>\n<h1>Let’s try if form work!</h1>\n<p>Click on preview.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s8.png\">Preview your form</a></p>\n<p>And now you see your form. Fill it with random values or if you remember your last\nexpense, fill it and <strong>Submit</strong> it.\nNow you should see <strong>1</strong> at <em>Responses</em>. It means you successfuly saved your first\nexpense. Congratulation.</p>\n<p>See structured responses data in Google Sheet. Click on <em>Responses</em>,\nand you will see <em>Google Docs</em> icon. Click on that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s9.png\">Preview your form</a></p>\n<p>Save it to your drive with whatever name you want. Click <em>Create</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s10.png\">Click on the create</a></p>\n<p>And after the moment, google will redirect you on the sheet page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./s11.png\">Sheet page</a></p>\n<p>Wohoo! And you see your first value which you filled a moment back.</p>\n<p>Basically, you are done. Let me explain why I previously wanted to rule the number\nto be with ”,” instead of ”.” . Google sheet doesn’t recognize the number with dot.\nWhen it sees dot inside the value, it switch the type of cell to <em>text</em>. In the future,\nwhen you want to make statistics over your accumulated data, you could run into\nproblems with that <em>text</em> value. However, now you are forced to write only\nvalid values and you will be fine. </p>\n<h1>Make “App” from your Form</h1>\n<p>Step 1. - Copy link of your form </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warning: Do not give this link to anyone. The person with this link can see and submit form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"./s12.png\">Copy link</a></p>\n<p>Step 2. - Open in your mobile browser. </p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Warning: I don&#39;t know how well is this feature supported in android phones. \nIphones supports add on screen webpage only in Safari browser. In Android phones\nshould work fine.</code> </p>\n<p>Okay, now you are done and next time you spend some money\nfill that form in 30 seconds, confirm and that’s it.\nYour data is saved.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Easy and effective way of managing expenses","date":"March 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ridiculous-expense-app/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-blog-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My new blog post!"}},"next":null}}
