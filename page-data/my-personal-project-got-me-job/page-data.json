You probably would like to know what is this project all about. Am I right? I hope I am. However, you should also ask, why I started to work on the project and why I even left the job? Why would anyone willingly leave a job, if you don’t have to?</p>\n<p>I was just not happy. As a self-employed person in the company, I would expect higher pay, instead I ended up with mediocre salary and after 6 months of working there it wasn’t rising. My expectations weren’t based only on national average salary but mainly based on my experience I had with the technologies we were working with. In addition, I graduated from university with a master degree. As the stats shown, absolvents from the university where I studied has higher average salary among other universities - so in the end it wasn’t mediocre salary - <strong>I was underpaid</strong>.</p>\n<p>I was learning lots of technologies while studying on school. I mean, they weren’t even taught. For example React, AWS, GraphQL, node.js and so on. Once on the seminar, extern lecturer asked audience:\n“How many of you have some experience with SPA? “. (SPA stands for Single Page Application).</p>\n<p>In the room were something about 50 people and I was the only one who raised a hand. I know, someone could just skip raising their hand but I’m not sure it was the case. Under the SPA, there are 3 most popular frameworks/libraries out there - React, Angular, Vue. So if someone knows at least one of them, he could vote. No one did, except me. Because I was learning them besides school things. This was my value I could add. Not only I knew more than I should. I was doing more as I was supposed to do.</p>\n<p>You could say that money isn’t the only thing that should motivate people to work. You are right and in this case, it wasn’t the only thing that demotivates me. There was something else.</p>\n<p>Long story short - I wasn’t on the same frequency with my colleagues. Imagine my and colleague’s values as vectors. Other’s vectors pointed almost in the same direction. I had feeling, that my vector has opposite direction and that I, in the end, haven’t added any value at all. Even more, sometimes I really thought it’d go faster without me there. Yes, you can say that I could learn and work exactly like them and adjust my vector to the same direction. The problem was, that the work values and standards they were using were basically in such a big conflict with mine, that I didn’t want to adjust because I felt they are not correct. The next question is, did I tell someone what I think about their values? Yes I do, but who would even think about what some “junior” thinks, right, we’ve got a senior developer here who knows everything. And that’s it. This is why I left.</p>\n<p>You may ask why I started the project in the first place. As a person who successfully graduated from school, I didn’t really have any evidence about my experience - that I really know technologies I claim I do. There is just this paper called CV which tells what you should allegedly know. Why is a young person always assigned as a junior developer? Because he is young it doesn’t necessarily mean that he knows nothing.\nIt was exactly the problem I was facing. I was sure I knew something, but didn’t have any evidence. Only part-time jobs while I was studying (in the IT of course).</p>\n<p>I was thinking about what to do. What to create that I could show all my knowledge I know. So I started working on the project-management web application or SaaS as you would say in modern hyped terms. It’s just like trello or jira or something between.</p>\n<p>// TODO add link to Lucinda post</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tell about time invested in the project</li>\n<li>Tell about that I’ve learned a lot of things doing that project</li>\n<li>Tell about struggling with project, what was my expectations?</li>\n<li>Tell why I started to looking for a new job anyway when I really believed in the project.</li>\n<li>Tell that I had two job offers and that the process of sending requests and choosing from different companies was the real struggle.</li>\n</ol>","wordCount":{"paragraphs":12,"sentences":54,"words":736},"frontmatter":{"title":"My personal project got me a job","date":"March 15, 2020","categories":["personal"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='141'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%2027l1%2027%204-3%2032-16c13%207%2022%2014%2022%2016s0%202%201%200v-2l18%209%209%203%208%201h2l-11-5-3-3c-1-2-2-2-2-1%200%202%200%202-2%201l-5-2-7-4-4-1-1-1c-1-2-1-2-3-1h-1c0-2%201-4%202-3l1-12c0-8%201-9%207-12%203-2%207-2%208-1a611%20611%200%200165-16c1-1-13-1-30-1H79v3l1%203c2%201-1%206-3%206l-2%202c0%201-1%201-3-1-4-2-13-1-18%204l-2%202-2%204c-3%203-2%207%201%209%202%200%202%201%201%201-2%200%201%203%203%203l1%201-9-2c-4-2-4-2-3-4%202-1%202-6%201-7l-3-6-1-3-2-4c0-2-1-3-2-3-2-1-2-1-1%201l1%207%202%209c2%204%202%205%201%205h-1l-3-2c-2-1-3-2-5-12S28%205%2026%203c-2%200-3-1-3-2L12%200H0v27M333%200l9%203a513%20513%200%200154%2014l4%202V0h-67m3%2041l-2%202%202%204%203%207c0%202%200%202%201%201h2l2%201%201%201v3l-1%203c0%202-1%202-3%202-3%200-3%201%201%203h3l1-1v2h3c1-2%203%200%201%201v2l1-1h1l3%205%202%203c-1%201%200%201%201%202%203%201%203%201%206-1l2-3-2-7-2-4c-1%205%200%207%201%208%201%202%201%202-2%201-4-1-6-3-7-8%200-6-3-16-4-16l-3-3c-1-3-7-9-8-9l-3%202m-6%2033a919%20919%200%2000-17%2015l-2%201%202%201c2%201%202%201%200%201-4-1-5%201-2%201l2%203h1l1%201%204-2%206-6%202-2%206-5%209-8%203-3-4-2-4-2-7%207m56%2032l-25%2024-11%2011h10l20-20%2020-19v-5l-1-4-13%2013'%20fill='%2329276c'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":2.8333333333333335,"src":"/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/bc3a8/cover1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/d278e/cover1.jpg 200w,\n/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/8539d/cover1.jpg 400w,\n/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/bc3a8/cover1.jpg 800w,\n/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/81ef8/cover1.jpg 1200w,\n/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/989b1/cover1.jpg 1600w,\n/static/75fa60f0bfc117e8c71b824054c3f6f1/ee2de/cover1.jpg 2550w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my-personal-project-got-me-job/","previous":{"excerpt":"Let me introduce Lucinda.
