<p>I am struggling a little bit. More school things I had to do popped up and I didn’t know what to
do first. Plus I have to go to work now at least 20 hours a week as contract says. When I come back, I’m quite tired and not able to complete these things on time. While I was doing on these boring school subjects, other things have shown up - which is even more demotivating. I am not even getting old things done to deadline, new things are showing up - also things I am not very interested in.</p>

<p>I am so proud of me, because I had some serious thoughts about leaving school at the moment. In life, we are sometimes supposed to do things we don’t like. Maybe it is a good decision, maybe not. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Martin.</p>
